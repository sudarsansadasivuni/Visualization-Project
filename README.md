Determining the nature of Damage Causing Tornadoes in United States of America
The code to be run is "Storm.html". 
The "earthquake.html" also shows earthquake dataset but not too good details about storm. So please consider "stormmain.html". 
The data files are added in data. Two of the data files were made by us by scrapping it from the bigger data files.
